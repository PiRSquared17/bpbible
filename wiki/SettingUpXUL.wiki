= Introduction =

How to set up a XUL and PyXPCOM instance to use with BPBible.

= Source =
The source is currently in SVN in branches/xul.

= Setup =
Start off looking at [http://pyxpcomext.mozdev.org/no_wrap/tutorials/pyxulrunner/python_xulrunner_about.html].

= Possibly useful tools and Firefox extensions =
PyShell (http://pyxpcomext.mozdev.org/samples.html)

XPCOMViewer (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7979)

Venkman (Javascript debugger, contains some of the layout we might want) (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/).

= Notes =
XULRunner has this annoying habit of letting a XULRunner instance hang around, and using that instance in future.  This causes problems if components are added and not registered on startup because a new instance is not being created.  Periodically run through in Task Manager and kill everything with your XULRunner stub name to make sure.
