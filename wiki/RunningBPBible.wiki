#summary How to run BPBible
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
There are two ways to run BPBible:
 # Run binaries under Windows
 # Run from source

Under Windows, you probably want to run the binaries. Under Linux, you need to run from source. Once you have run it, you may want to [InstallingBooks install books].

= Running binaries under Windows =
To run the binaries under Windows, download the BPBible installer (`bpbible-x.x-setup.exe`). For the installer, run it and follow the prompts. Now run bpbible.exe in the application directory, or use the Start Menu, Desktop and Quick Launch shortcuts, if you chose to create them.

= Running from source =
== Dependencies ==
To build from source, you will need to have the following:
 # wxPython 2.8 (preferably 2.8.7) 
 # Python 2.5 (though older versions may work)
 # SWORD 1.5.11
 # Windows or Linux

BPBible SVN has been tested somewhat under Mac, and it mostly works. Some things, such as verse tooltips, don't yet work though.  This support is likely to make its way into the next BPBible release.

== Building the SWIG bindings ==
The SWIG bindings are located in the bindings/swig directory of the SWORD
source code. Instructions on how to build are supplied in the README file in
that directory.

If you want to install them under Linux, the procedure will probably be:
{{{
cd package
./configure
make pythonswig
make python_make
cd python
python setup.py install
}}}
== Running BPBible ==
Once the SWIG bindings are installed, unzip the BPBible source. From there, run `python bpbible.py`.
