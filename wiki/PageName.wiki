#summary Searching in BPBible

= Introduction =

BPBible provides its own searching platform, allowing cross-verse searches.

= Details =

To run the cross verse search, you will have to index the module beforehand. If you do not index it, you will be restricted to the SWORD searches, which are much slower and do not provide cross-verse searching.

Example search (in ESV):
Search Type: Combined (means you can combine Phrase, Regular Expression and
Multiword searches)
Search Proximity: 10 (Search terms to be within approximately 10 words of each other)
Find: "Fruit of the spirit" self-control

Now click search.
This will give 1 reference, Galatians 5:22-23, as expected
