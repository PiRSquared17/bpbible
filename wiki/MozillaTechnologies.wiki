= Introduction =

The Mozilla Platform has a lot of available functionality.  Much of this functionality is either:
  * Provided by Python in some form;
  * Provided by BPBible current in some form;
  * Able to be done better our way than the Mozilla way.

Some of the technology is very good, so we really need to evaluate it and to decide what is useful and what isn't, and more importantly _why_ we make the decisions that we do.
