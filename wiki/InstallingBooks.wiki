The main download point for books is at http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/index.jsp.
When you download books, make sure you download the raw zip version. 

Using WinZip, or a similar program, unzip these zip files into a directory of your choice. Now go `File > Set Sword Paths` and click the Add Item button (it has a green plus sign on it). Navigate to the directory you unzipped to, and click OK. It should now load the books you have downloaded.
